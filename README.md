Parameterized Fast GSEA

[pfgsea][] extends the functionality of [fgsea][]. The package is designed to quickly perform multiple GSEA comparisons on RNA-seq differential expression results.

## Installation

This is an [R][] package.

### [Bioconductor][] method

We recommend installing the package with [BiocManager][].

```r
if (!require("BiocManager")) {
    install.packages("BiocManager")
}
BiocManager::install("remotes")
BiocManager::install("acidgenomics/pfgsea")
```
