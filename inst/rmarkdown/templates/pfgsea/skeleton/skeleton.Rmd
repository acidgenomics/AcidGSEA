# Load FGSEAList object

Import the `FGSEAList` S4 class object. This single object contains everything we need to visualize the GSEA results.

```{r load-object}
file <- params$fgsealist_file
object <- import(file)
name <- basenameSansExt(file)
rm(file)
stopifnot(
    is(object, "FGSEAList"),
    is.character(name)
)
invisible(validObject(object))
print(object)
```

# Ranked gene list input

A ranked `numeric vector` [gene list](https://github.com/GuangchuangYu/DOSE/wiki/how-to-prepare-your-own-geneList) is used as input for fast, parameterized GSEA. This is stored as a `RankedList` S4 class object by pfgsea, and internally named as `rankedlist` in the `metadata()` slot of the `FGSEAList` object.

It requires three features:

1. numeric: test statistic (*preferred*) or log2 fold change. For [DESeq2][], the test statistic is generated using the Wald test by default (see `DESeq2::DESeq()`, `DESeq2::nbinomWaldTest()`).
2. named: every number has a name, the corresponding gene ID.
3. sorted: number should be sorted in decreasing order.

Note that [MSigDb][] requires that the identifiers map either to HGNC names (gene symbols) or Entrez IDs. We prefer to map using the gene symbols, but these are not 1:1 for all Ensembl gene IDs (e.g. ENSG00000000003 = TSPAN6). In the event that there are Ensembl gene IDs per HGNC symbol, we're taking the average of the values here.

# MSigDb GMT files

Here we are using pathways from the MSigDB database. GSEA requires a gene list containing names that match the gene names in the MSigDb pathways list (i.e. gene symbols instead of Ensembl gene IDs).

Before proceeding, first download the [MSigDb 6.2 release](http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb/download_file.jsp?filePath=/resources/msigdb/6.2/msigdb_v6.2_files_to_download_locally.zip) and extract the ZIP archive, which will contain GMT files. Note that e-mail registration is required to access resources at the Broad Institute.

# Running GSEA

All genes can be used in Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). GSEA aggregates the per gene statistics across genes within a gene set, therefore making it possible to detect situations where all genes in a predefined set change in a small but coordinated way. Since it is likely that many relevant phenotypic differences are manifested by small but consistent changes in a set of genes. GSEA uses a ranked list of genes (here ranked by the test statistic), without applying a per-gene *P* value significance cutoff. This allows the analysis to use more information to identify enriched biological processes. The [GSEA introduction](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1239896) goes into more detail about some of the advantages of this approach.

This section is a modified version of Stephen Turner's excellent [DESeq results to pathways in 60 Seconds with the fgsea package](https://stephenturner.github.io/deseq-to-fgsea/) vignette. The [fgsea vignette](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/fgsea/inst/doc/fgsea-tutorial.html) also has additional useful information.

Each row corresponds to a tested pathway. The columns are the following:

- `pathway`: name of the pathway.
- `pval`: an enrichment *P* value.
- `padj`: BH-adjusted *P* value.
- `ES`: enrichment score, same as in Broad GSEA implementation.
- `NES`: enrichment score normalized to mean enrichment of random samples of the same size.
- `nMoreExtreme`: a number of times a random gene set had a more extreme enrichment score value.
- `size`: size of the pathway after removing genes not present in 'names(stats)'.
- `leadingEdge`: vector with indexes of leading edge genes that drive the enrichment.

Here we are arranging the tables by normalized enrichment score (NES), positive to negative.

# Export tables

Here we are exporting the GSEA tables from the object, organized per contrast.

```{r export}
export(
    object = object,
    name = name,
    dir = params$output_dir
)
```

# Hallmark

First, let's use the *Homo sapiens* Hallmark collection from MSigDb. Hallmark gene sets summarize and represent specific well-defined biological states or processes and display coherent expression. These gene sets were generated by a computational methodology based on identifying overlaps between gene sets in other MSigDb collections and retaining genes that display coordinate expression.

The `fgsea::gmtPathways()` function will take a GMT file from MSigDb and turn it into a list. Each element in the list is a character vector of genes in the pathway.
