* Development
** TODO Work on adding support for edgeR DGEList and limma into RankedList.
** TODO Explore alternative approaches to averaging gene symbols. Should we
   rework our default approach to map to Entrez gene identifiers instead? Is
   this less problematic? Alternatively, can we select for unique gene symbols
   that don't map to gene scaffolds, non-coding genes? Think about this one...
** TODO Compare results against GSEA Java client and gseapy Python approach.
** TODO `convertToHuman: May need to ensure that GenomicRanges are sorted by
   identifier name, or we may need to filter out scaffold identifiers.
   Otherwise, could potentially run into unwanted matches:
   e.g. "FH" vs. "LRG_504".
